2048
====

Description:
------------

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 

Rules:
------

* 2048 is played on a 4 x 4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys by choosing a direction (up, down, left or right).

* Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.

* If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.

* If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion will combine. 

* If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two.

* The user's score starts at zero, and is increased whenever two tiles combine, by the value of the new tile.

* The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board.
