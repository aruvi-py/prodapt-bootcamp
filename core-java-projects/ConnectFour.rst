   be the beginner; moves are made alternatively, one by turn.
-  Moves entails in placing new pieces on the board; pieces slide
   downwards from upper holes, falling down to the last row or piling up
   on the last piece introduced in the same column. So, in every turn
   the introduced piece may be placed at most on seven different
   squares.
