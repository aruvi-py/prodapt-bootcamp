[^1]: For the mini project, trainees were divided randomly into groups of 5 each and asked to choose from a pool of five classic games: Minesweeper, Uno, 2048, Scrabble, and Ludo. They were asked to implement these games (or whatever subset of the game they could manage in a week) with a GUI (despite not having formally discussed GUI frameworks in the sessions.) Trainees learnt and familiarized themselves with the JavaFX framework. One group took the decision that JavaFX does not fit well with their project and used Java Swing instead (and realized that they could have taken this decision earlier than the last day). The pedagogic purpose of the project was learning how to work in teams, learning how to divide work in a software engineering project, learning to read the docs, and learning to approach a completely new programming framework.
